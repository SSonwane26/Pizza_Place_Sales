Exploratory Data Analysis using [MySQL](https://github.com/SSonwane26/Pizza_Place_Sales/blob/main/MySQLscript.sql)

 The dataset comprises multiple tables, including orders, order details, pizzas, and pizza types, which have been thoroughly analyzed to extract meaningful information.
 
Through a rigorous analytical process, I have explored the dataset, cleaned the data, performed transformations, and visualized the findings. This analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of the pizza business, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

Key areas of focus in the analysis include examining sales trends across different months, identifying the most and least ordered pizzas, and uncovering patterns related to pizza sizes and prices. By diving into these aspects, I shed light on customer behaviors, preferences, and potential opportunities for business growth and optimization.

The analysis not only showcases the insights obtained but also demonstrates the analytical skills, data processing techniques, and visualization capabilities employed throughout the process. By making this repository available, I aim to share knowledge, inspire further analysis, and foster collaboration among data enthusiasts and pizza industry professionals.

Feel free to explore the code, data transformations, visualizations, and accompanying documentation in this repository. I encourage you to delve into the details of the analysis and leverage the insights to enhance decision-making, drive customer satisfaction, and boost profitability in the pizza business.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository, and I hope this analysis proves informative and valuable to your understanding of the pizza industry and data analysis techniques.
